<h2>INSIGHTS</h2>

Adventure movies seem to be the most profitable in general terms having ups and down.

However drama movies have an upward trend in 2019 taking into consideration that drama is the most prevelant genre across years.

Steven Spielberg is the director who generated the highest gross in total for all his movies.

The movie with highest IMDB Rating and number of votes is "The Shawshank Redemption".

Nevertheless the gross is low and there is no trend between imdb rating and gross.

Tom Hanks and Robert de Niro are the actors that have starred most in the list of movies.

Tom Hanks is also the highest paid actor.
